It’s nice to meet you!

I’m a student studying maths at the University of Edinburgh. I also do a lot of more computery things, from Freshair — Edinburgh’s student radio — where I’m the webmaster, to CompSoc — the computing society at Edinburgh — where I run SigWeb, the web development branch.

I’ve worked in a breadth of technologies, from Rust to React, and played around in way more. I’ve even got a sort of blog where I write about …stuff.

You can read some of my articles [here](/posts) — but don’t feel obliged to, I’m very much still exploring the medium.

Have a good day!
